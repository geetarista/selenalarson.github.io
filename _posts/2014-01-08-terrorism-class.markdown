I write so much about online education, I figured I should probably take a course myself. I've been wanting, for a while, to dive into a Coursera classroom. Luckily, I found a class that's perfect.

<strong>Terrorism and Counterterrorism: Comparing Theory and Practice</strong>

Yes, this is the class I signed up for. I'm absolutely stoked to be taking it. Those of you who have known me for a while (or well, anyway) know that I am passionate about global studies, politics, and the social injustices that plague our world. Eventually, one day, I hope to be writing about those issues.

For now, I'm content taking a course taught through the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. Professor Bakker is the director of the Center for Terrorism and Counterterrorism at the university and a fellow at the International Centre for Counter Terrorism - The Hague.

Already I'm impressed with Coursera for featuring such legit instructors. Beyond that, he's a really awesome teacher. It's only week one and I've found myself immersed in the literature and lectures, even researching further to better understand some of the more well-known terrorists. (Or are they freedom fighters? A question we address.)

<strong>Some Facts From The First Week</strong>
<ol>
	<li>The 1890s is considered "The Golden Age Of Assassination." Yes, this is a thing.</li>
	<li>September 11, 2001 was a terrorist attack considered to happen during the "religious wave" of terrorism, a categorization of the threats and attacks that have happened since 1979.</li>
	<li>The idea that we are living in a post-9/11 world might be true in the U.S., but not around the world.</li>
	<li>Soon we will experience a new wave of terrorism. What that will be is unknown. But it's sure to be just as shitty as the rest of them.</li>
	<li>The word Â and definition of "terrorism" didn't even exist until the mid-20th century.</li>
</ol>
Anyway, it's been a great week so far, and I'm looking forward to continuing the course. It's ridiculously interesting, and even though I'm only a week into the class, I highly recommend taking a massive open online course through Coursera or another platform like Udacity.
