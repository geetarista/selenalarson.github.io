Yes, it's official. I'm searchable on the App Store. In collaboration with Soon a Light On, LLC, I have successfully designed and published an iOS app.<p>

If you don't know, I have a blog called <u><a href="http://seekingcities.com">Seeking Cities</a></u>. Since I travel a bit I like to write about the places I go and experiences that regular tourists might not get to experience.<p>

Check out &amp; <u><a href="http://tiny.cc/seekingcities">download the app</a></u>. Let me know what you think. There are some minor changes I would like to work out, but I am quite happy with it.
