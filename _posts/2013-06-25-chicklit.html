Here is an excerpt from the book I'm writing. It's not for everyone, but it's fun for me. Enjoy.
<h4>The first thing insects worry about is getting stepped on. Followed closely by being breakfast for a larger creature.</h4>
It seems as though the bigger you are, the more small problems seem huge and you can turn anything into a heart-wrenching analysis of how much you screwed up. As humans our problems seem gargantuan.<p>

I spend most of my time with insects, researching the smallest creatures and paying attention to their problems instead of uncovering the dirt on my own. No, I would much rather talk about how much our society would suffer as a result of bees becoming extinct than talking about myself. I relate to bees.<p>

It’s the end of my final semester of grad school, and in a few short months I will be a biologist. You can call me Dr. Anders. It seems as though the past six years all I have been paying attention to is nature’s patterns and now realize I have become lost in them.<p>

The crystalline structure of a maple leaf makes our lives seem a little more complicated.
<p>
All anyone wants is happily ever after. If they tell you anything else, they’re lying. I’m one of those people. Living in a constant bubble of jaded optimism where I think I only want success in my job, a constant cornucopia of food in the refrigerator, and friends that I would die for.
<p>
So, according to me I have everything. According to society- and Disney- I don’t.
<p>
Which is what makes a wedding the most tantalizingly bittersweet event ever placed on a single scientist’s calendar. There is plenty of food and wine, but with it comes the ever present whispers that society (and Disney) automatically mutter under their breath: “Where is her happily ever after?”
<p>
I always answer that question with one that baffles the asker: “I’ve already got it.”
