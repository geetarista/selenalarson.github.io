It's that time of year again. As 2013 comes to a close, I'm sure many of us are taking a look back at our successes (and sometimes failures)—and this year I've had many.<p>

Perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in my life was moving to San Francisco and becoming a full-time journalist. I never thought I'd be writing about technology, but here in the Bay, there is plenty of tech news to cover. I was lucky enough to be hired as ReadWrite's social reporter working for an inspiring team of dedicated journalists. (Although social is my official beat, I cover a wide variety of topics. My job is fun.)<p>

So I thought I'd put together some of my favorite pieces this year. You may notice all of them have one thing in common: these stories highlight ways people are using technology to make a difference in the world.<p>

It's easy to get caught up in the Silicon Valley bubble, and the even smaller bubble that is San Francisco. We can laugh at the startups that have meaningless names that create services to fuel desires of the tech elite, but for each company/service/product we shake our head at, there are countless others using technology to empower society and deliver opportunity for those that might not have it.<p>

If you haven't read these yet, maybe check them out. Not because I wrote them, but because it's nice to read stories about good people doing great things.<p>

If there is one thing I've learned these last few years, it's that technical skills are important.<p>

Tech education is suffering in many schools across the country. Oftentimes educators don't have the skills or devices necessary to teach students to program or engineer projects, so they have to learn outside the classroom.<p>

There has been <u><a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/12/18/learn-to-code-trend-2013" target="_blank">much debate this year</a></u> on whether or not everyone should learn to code. A variety of 2013 initiatives pushed support for programming education, not just in the classroom, but also later in life.<p>

In this piece, I took a look at what educators are doing to empower students to learn technical skills, both inside and outside the classroom. Turns out, there are a lot of programs looking to help students perfect technical skills and inspire them to follow career paths in tech.<p>

<a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/10/10/chicago-police-gangsters-facebook" target="_blank"><strong><u>Chicago Police Use A Real-Life Graph Search To Stop Crime </strong></a></u><p>

Facebook's Graph Search is a highly-sophisticated search engine that connects people based on profile information like friends, Likes, places and pictures. Basically, you can search for something like "Women Who Live In San Francisco And Like The Giants" and Facebook will produce a list of women who fit the profile.<p>

Seems crazy, right? In some ways yes, but it's cool to see how something like this could work offline and connect social communities in the real world.<p>

That's what the Chicago Police Department is doing to fight crime in the city. They are taking a look at different gang members and their known associates, and using the relationship data to determine the likelihood the person will be involved in a crime, or even the when they might die.<p>

On NASA's 55th anniversary, the government shutdown. The space agency was considered "non-essential," therefore, a number of operations ceased for the duration of the shutdown.<p>

It's not just the government that considers sciences non-essential. Many schools are cutting STEM programs, and the number of women in tech and engineering fields is tiny compared to men.<p>

But in our hyper-connected world, there is hope for STEM programs. I took a look at the ways people and organizations are making science cool again by using Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and the like. Also, I got to interview some folks at NASA, so that was pretty rad.<p>

<strong><u><a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/08/27/facebook-internet-org-chicago-smart-communities" target="_blank">Hey Facebook! Connecting The World To The Web Isn't Enough</a></u></strong><p>

Facebook has a grand vision of bringing the internet to the world. It's not purely altruistic—if more people have internet, more people will use Facebook.<p>

But I've been to some of the communities Facebook so lovingly wants to take under its wing. The third world countries ruled by oppressive governments that don't even have electricity, let alone mobile devices, let alone the internet. So it seems to me the company's vision is faulty.<p>

Right now it's just a moonshot idea. It joins Google's Loom project as a grand initiative to <del>take over </del> connect the world.<p>

Although I know there are significant logistics to figure out, I gave Facebook the benefit of the doubt and took a look at a different organization that actually <em>did </em>attempt to connect its communities and provide opportunities to its residents. In Chicago, the Smart Communities initiative brought tech-centric instructional classes and internet availability to underserved communities. It took one year and $7 million to achieve just a part of their goal, but it gave families and students more opportunities to further their education and careers.<p>

It was successful in Chicago, and though the city is very different than the global communities Facebook wants to penetrate, it's worth taking a look at how this project came to fruition and use it as a possible blueprint for connecting cities in the future.<p>

Anonymous, the hacker collective that regularly raises awareness of persecuted communities across the globe, launched a Twitter storm for the Rohingya people this summer.<p>

The Rohingya are tremendously oppressed in Myanmar. Facing genocide, religious and governmental persecution, the United Nations classified the more than 800,000 Rohingya people Myanmar one of the world's most persecuted minorities.<p>

Anonymous caught wind of the southeast Asian peoples' suffering, and decided to launch #OpRohingya to raise awareness and to hopefully drive interest and help for the community. I spoke with Anonymous representatives and journalist and activist Heather Marsh about their mission that became a popular topic of conversation on Twitter.<p>

<strong>Here's to 2014!</strong><p>

As much as I like writing about Twitter's stock price, I prefer examining the ways technology is shaping and changing our world for the better. I'm lucky I work for editors who allow me to pursue stories that aren't rooted in Silicon Valley and write about topics that are important to me.<p>

In 2014, I'm looking forward to continuing this trend.
