Today my organization (read: three coworkers &amp; I) sat down to go over our plans for 2013. We did things a little differently, though. Jennifer sent us all <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/2012/12/consider-not-setting-goals-in.html?cm_mmc=email-_-newsletter-_-you_at_work-_-you_at_work122612&amp;referral=00211&amp;utm_source=newsletter_you_at_work&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=you_at_work122612"> <u>this article</a></u></font> from the Harvard Business Review about setting goals, or rather, not setting goals. It's a really interesting take on how goals can actually have a negative affect on the goal-setter.

Instead, this year we talked about our areas of focus. Of course we all have things we would like to specifically achieve, but it's important to recognize those areas of focus that you can most improve upon, thus being successful in multiple areas instead of being pigeonholed into one particular thing.

The areas that I am focusing on are my: fitness, writing, freelancing, and organizational skills. I have a few specifics I would like to tackle of course, one being running a 5k in less than 30 minutes. But if I can focus on the overarching theme of those areas I need to improve upon, then all aspects that are a part of the area will benefit.

Last year I wrote a list of goals. I had 10 on my list; I accomplished five. However, there were many things I did accomplish that I had no idea I would be able to do. Had I written "travel more" on my list of resolutions and not "climb Machu Picchu," then I would be perfectly happy with the fact I visited Israel &amp; many different states this year instead of being disappointed I didn't make it to Peru.

As you can tell, quite a bit of my list had to do with traveling. Unfortunately, I didn't accomplish any of those, but got other unique experiences including visiting the <u><a href="http://seekingcities.com/israel/">ancient city of Jerusalem</a> </u>and <u><a href="http://seekingcities.com/a-white-christmas-in-northern-arizona/">experiencing the Grand Canyon</a></u> for the first time ever.

Recreating my website and personal brand is something I definitely need to focus on this year. That's why I created this new website. It's something very different than I had before: a little brighter, a little cleaner, and a little more like me. So let me know what you think, I'd love to hear from you.

Even though goals weren't directly set, I did end up deciding on a BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal) that I hope to accomplish this year. By the end of 2013, I will be a published author. Now, this is where I tell you to stay tuned so you can purchase my book later this year.

Happy new year all. Let's make it a great one.
