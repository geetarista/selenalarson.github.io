On the corner of 4th street and Mission, a young man came up to a friend and me, asking if we wanted to buy homemade cinnamon rolls from a plastic bowl he carried. 
<p>
We shook our heads.
<p>
The man walked away, offering more strangers his goodies, which no one purchased.
<p>
“This city,” my friend croaked, watching the young man—eyes tearing up, residual frustration bubbling up from a heart-to-heart earlier.
<p>
“It’s really hard sometimes,” I finished, and put my arm around her. There was so much I wished the two of us could change.
<p>
My phone vibrated. “Our Lyft is here.”
<p>
We walked across the street to meet the small black car with a pink mustache, and as we walked up, a man in a police uniform stepped out of a nearby building. 
<p>
“Is this your ride?” the gruff man asked.
<p>
“Uh, yes,” I replied, my hand paused, outstretched, reaching for the door. 
<p>
“No ticket for him then.” The man turned and walked inside, and I heaved a sigh of relief and fell into the front seat.
<p>
“That was close,” my driver, Ruben, said as I shut the door. “How weird, I’ve never had that happen before.”
<p>
“How’s it going?” I asked, buckling in. 
<p>
“Great now! And it’s a sunny day. You can’t be angry on a sunny day like today.” 
<p>
No, I guess you really can’t. The weather was perfect.
<p>
We pulled away from the building and the watchful eyes of the security-maybe-police officer. Ruben explained he’d been driving for Lyft for six months, and that he was a native of San Francisco. 
<p>
“We’re a dying breed,” he said. 
<p>
Ruben only left the city for college. He lived in Hayward for five years while he studied theater and the arts. He moved back to San Francisco three years ago—and the city is as transitional as it’s ever been. 
<p>
“There’s no value to things,” he said, talking about the differences he sees in the city he grew up in and the one he lives in now. “Like, if I have a local bar that I like, and suddenly people Yelp about it, everyone goes there. It loses that “thing” that made it special.”
<p>
Ruben lives in Haight-Ashbury, and after spending some time acting, he’s taken up the piano. He doesn’t perform himself, but he’s filled in for people in different gigs. 
<p>
I’d pay to see him play. You can tell he’s good, just by hearing him talk about the music. 
<p>
“I’m embarrassed to say, I haven’t spent much time in the Haight. I moved here a year and a half ago, and I still haven’t gone many places.” I hate admitting that to people—I know there’s a world outside work, work events, and my three favorite bars, and I need to do more to discover it. 
<p>
“There’s a great place called Cha Cha Cha,” he said, laughing at my lameness. 
<p>
“Okay—if I go, I’ll write a Yelp review,” I joked.
<p>
“See! This is what happens!” 
<p>
(If you’re reading this and decide to go there, you better not write a Yelp review. Ruben will never forgive me.)
<p>
He asked if I missed Arizona. I told him honestly: No. 
<p>
“There is one thing I miss though—my best friend had her first baby right when I left, and I’m missing him grow up.” 
<p>
“Oh! Are you like one of those friend aunts? I had so many of those growing up, and then I realized I wasn’t actually related to them,” he laughed, and so did I. “They’re the best.”
<p>
We pulled up to the corner I always ask Lyft drivers to drop me off. I never give them my actual address—I’m still not used to the fact random strangers with a car and cell phone will know where I live. 
<p>
Just before I shut the door, Ruben called out. 
<p>
“You need to go explore more—it’s a great city.”
<p>
This weekend I will take his advice.
