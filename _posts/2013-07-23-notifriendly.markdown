NotiFriendly is making getting up in the morning a little more special.<p>

The San Francisco-based startup launching early next month bills itself as an “Uber for non-morning people,” but instead of driving you to your destination, a person comes to your house and rings your doorbell to make sure you get up on time.<p>

“It can be really hard getting up in the morning, especially if you’re hung-over from a Meetup,” said founder and CEO Mike Doe. “So I thought, why not pay someone to come ring my doorbell? Because my phone alarm probably won’t work.”<p>

With NotiFriendly, you don’t just get a doorbell ring. The application gives you the opportunity to upgrade to a Man in a Tuxedo, an option above the standard Guy Wearing Jeans.<p>

The initial funding round was led by Mrs. Angela Doe, Mike’s grandmother and staunch supporter of whatever her grandchildren do.<p>
“I’m so proud that Mike is becoming a businessman,” Mrs. Doe said. “I think his company might be the next Twatter.”<p>

The Stanford grad and his team of two developers and a designer aren’t new to the startup game. Their previous endeavors included BroStar, a Pinterest for men wearing sunglasses at night and Bender, a dating application similar to Tinder.<p>

“We were just having a beer in the Mission and thought NotiFriendly was a great idea!” co-founder and lead designer Mark Martin said.<p>

The application will be available on iPhone and Android devices starting August 1.
