<strong>Uber San Francisco drivers strike over benefits, treatment
</strong><p>
Last Friday, Uber drivers congregated outside the offices of the transportation startup in SOMA, parking their cars in outrage at the treatment they receive. <!--more-->Almost 30 drivers took part in the protest that happened during rush hour on March 15 and continued into the weekend.

Drivers <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=b-IiEgF0JiI">told the media</a></u> they are upset about treatment they are receiving from the company including a lack of a company insurance policy and not receiving tips. Uber’s drivers aren’t licensed as a limousine service or taxi company and have seen their fair share of <u><a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/11/14/class-action-lawsuit-filed-against-uber-by-san-francisco-taxicab-drivers-citing-unfair-business-competition/">legal dustups</a></u> in the past.

Uber’s GM in San Francisco released this statement to <u><a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/03/16/uber-black-towncar-drivers-strike-in-san-francisco-over-compensation-terms-and-treatment/">The Next Web</a></u>:

<i>“Uber is 100 percent committed to working with only the highest quality transportation providers, thousands of whom are using Uber to grow their businesses and provide quick and reliable service to San Franciscans. Drivers who don’t know the city well or who are unsafe or unprofessional ultimately receive consistently negative feedback from riders that we cannot ignore.”</i>

With what is sure to be a busy weekend with Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations on Saturday and Sunday, transportation via the mobile application might be affected. The 48-hour strike has left some passengers frustrated with a lack of service, but many are not surprised by the reaction from outraged drivers.

“Was wondering when this might happen,” one user <u><a href="https://twitter.com/digivish/status/313087870325895169">tweeted out.</a></u> “Sooner than I thought.”

So far there haven’t been serious rider blackouts due to the strike, but many drivers are refusing to accept calls for rides this weekend.
