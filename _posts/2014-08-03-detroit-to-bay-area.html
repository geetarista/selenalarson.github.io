Karl the Fog loomed conspicuously over the city, and I sadly put my sunglasses on the top of my head as I stepped outside my office and into a waiting car. I was heading to a midday meeting.
<p>
Hisham was waiting in a grey Toyota that smelled faintly of cigarettes and aerosol spray.
<p>
“Where you headed?” he asked.
<p>
I told him, and he cautiously rolled away. 
<p>
We were quick with the pleasantries all Lyft drivers and their riders exchange—the weather, our jobs, what we’re up to that day. And, of course, how we managed to get here in the first place. 
<p>
Hisham had recently moved to the Bay Area from Detroit to live with his two sons. He left behind a successful clothing store and a very cheap mortgage. 
<p>
His store was a target for violence—and after a while, it became too much for him.
<p>
“My clothing store was held up two or three times,” he said. “The money was good, but if someone shoots you, what do you need the money for?”
<p>
<i>Three times</i> someone held a gun to Hisham. Twice he stayed and tried to move on—the third time was the final straw. He knew it was time to go. 
<p>
“There’s no security in Detroit,” he said. “You call the police, and the police don’t show.” 
<p>
He recalled fond memories of Detroit, too, but nothing that could prevent him from moving to be with his family. Though he said he missed owning a home—something very few people in San Francisco can even consider. 
<p>
“I used to have a big, big house for $900 per month,” he said. 
<p>
I understood his melancholy—that was my rent for a two bedroom house in Arizona. 
<p>
The subject turned to our love of the area, and the reasons why we’re willing to pay outrageous rent to stay here. It’s taken me a year or so, but I’ve finally come to love it, though there are some aspects that take some time to appreciate. And a lot of things that I hope I'll never get used to.
<p>
“What’s the best thing about the Bay Area?” I asked.
<p>
“It’s easy to work, especially for young people,” he said, smiling. “There’s a lot of opportunity over here.”
<p>
“We are both very lucky to have jobs, that’s for sure,” I said. 
<p>
The fog had yet to clear, even though we had arrived at my destination in the heart of the Mission. I pulled my sunglasses down anyway. 
<p>
“Take care,” I said. “Maybe the sun will come back out soon.” 
<p>
He waved, and joined the rest of the afternoon traffic.
