<strong>Popular messaging app hits 1M users and almost $2M in seed funding</strong><p>

Just over a week ago, <u><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/messageme/id562075622?mt=8">MessageMe</a></u> made a splash in the smartphone market and in that short time has made its way into over one million users' hands. Today, MessageMe founders <u><a href="http://blog.messageme.com/post/45752247883/announcing-our-seed-investors">announced their seed funding</a></u> of $1.9 million from investors including True Ventures, First Round Capital, Google Ventures, SVAngel, Resolut.vc, Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock Partners and Social+Capital Partnership.

The app hit a bump in the road this weekend when <u><a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2416717,00.asp">Facebook blackballed</a></u> MessageMe users from finding their friends via the social network. But the application jumped back and Facebook's ostracization seems to have barely ruffled feathers.

The hot new app is currently sending over 500 notifications per second worldwide and is most popular in the United States and Europe. In the United States, more than 10 million doodles and over four million songs on iTunes have been shared. Founders Alex, Arjun, Justin and Vivek <u><a href="http://blog.messageme.com/post/45752247883/announcing-our-seed-investors">said on their blog</a></u>, "We believe a core communication service like messaging can, and should, do more to keep up with the technological advances in the smartphone market."

The messenger is fast, fun and easy to use, with features that include picture messaging, doodle abilities, music, voice and video messages, and location sharing. One of my favorite features is the ability to pull photos and videos right from Google and YouTube. It also makes chats much faster and easier to share information with a group.

The founders are quickly moving forward with the application, promising new features and updates in the near future. In the over saturated market of mobile messaging, MessageMe definitely outshines them all.
