Have you ever ran in the San Francisco Marathon? Or the Half Marathon?
<p>
I haven’t, but I cheered today! My friend Anne ran the Half, and I came prepared with a lovely poster at the finish line. 
<p>
If you’ve never spent time at the end of a race finish line, I highly recommend it. It reminds me of being in an airport, when people land and they’re so happy to fall into the arms of friends and family. Even after completely exhausting themselves after 13 or 26 miles, they were all smiles. 
<p>
So, congratulations Anne.
<p>
We celebrated with bottomless mimosas in the Mission, and of course after drinking a few, I needed a Lyft.
<p>
Damon picked me up. 
<p>
It was his third day of driving for Lyft, and I’m not sure he was as familiar with the city as other drivers. I didn’t mind though—we ended up going a bit further than necessary, but, he was great company so I didn’t mind. 
<p>
You San Francisco residents might have passed by Damon before and not realized it. He’s a construction manager, and is working on a new building downtown. Though he lives down the peninsula, he works in San Francisco during the week. If you see him, be sure to say hello.
<p>
His cousin convinced him to drive for Lyft and pick up some extra cash. There’s not a lot of people that need drivers down where he lives, so he comes up to San Francisco for this, too. 
<p>
“I’ve found that happy medium,” he said. 
<p>
Damon used to live in the city. “I lived in Fillmore ten years ago,” he told me. “The Fillmore district has gotten a little better since then.”
<p>
I live near the Fillmore district. I told him one of my favorite San Francisco events is the Jazz Festival. Not necessarily because of the music, but because of the confluence of art, culture, and jazz. 
<p>
“I had a friend from Zimbabwe that made the most beautiful art,” Damon said. “But he ended up moving away.”
<p>
Damon used to be in the Navy—he served our country for nine years. 
<p>
“I brought cargo in and out of the water. I’m from California, and that’s all I really needed,” he told me. 
<p>
But it wasn’t all cargo he was working to bring home. He was also a religious man. 
<p>
“I was the religious Petty Officer,” Damon said. “I assisted the Chaplain. But I never had the opportunity to go overseas.” 
<p>
I come from a bit of a military background, and my brother-in-law is in the Army. There’s a special place in my heart for people who are willing to give up their lives for our country. It takes a certain kind of courage to enlist—people don’t say it enough, but we are eternally grateful. 
<p>
We pulled up to my corner, and I asked if I could take a selfie. I don’t think he was expecting that, because he could not stop laughing.
<p>
“Now that’s funny!” he said. 
<p>
“Welcome to day 3 of driving,” I replied.
