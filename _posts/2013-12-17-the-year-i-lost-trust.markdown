title:  "2013: The Year I Lost Trust In Everything"

I guess it makes sense that the year I moved to San Francisco and became a full-time reporter was the year I lost trust in everything. Don't get me wrong, I have a healthy skeptical outlook on the world, and for the most part believe the best in people. I still fancy myself an optimist, but one that thinks well-intentioned actions could perhaps come with a price.<p>

As a journalist new to the tech scene, I had my fair share of learning experiences. In j-school we're taught to question everything: "If your mother says she loves you, check it out." Because my investigative skills were a little dusty before joining the team at ReadWrite, I was quickly reminded that there is a polish and shine to everything companies and people will tell you, and very often a dirty streak under the buzzwords. Don't fall for the shiny objects; dig into the dirt.<p>

I have to say, it's really fun when you do it.<p>

So, in honor of it being the end of the year and the start of new beginnings, I thought I'd take a moment to look back at what turned me into a citizen of the world that questions everything in the hopes of turning you into one, too.<p>

<strong>1. The NSA Is Super Shady</strong><p>

<a href="http://media.giphy.com/media/dFpG6KdpSEzC0/giphy.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-487" alt="nsa" src="http://media.giphy.com/media/dFpG6KdpSEzC0/giphy.gif" width="480" height="265" /></a>

<p>
So the National Security Agency is <u><a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/multimedia/timeline-edward-snowden-revelations.html" target="_blank">collecting data on millions of humans</a></u> and invading our privacy by tracking phone records and personal information sent and received over online platforms. That's just the tip of the iceberg; they also do the same to citizens and representatives of <u><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-nsa-spied-on-brazilian-mexican-presidents/" target="_blank">countries we consider allies</a></u>. Some people may argue that if you have nothing to hide, you shouldn't worry about it. Those people would be wrong. In fact, a federal judge agreed. Recently a <u><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/16/nsa-phone-surveillance-likely-unconstitutional-judge?CMP=fb_us" target="_blank">federal judge in Washington</a></u> ruled that the NSA collecting Americans' telephone records is likely a violation of the constitution.<p>

Thanks to the whistle blower and former government contractor Edward Snowden, classified documents were turned over that prove the NSA sanctimoniously abuses its powers and gets away with it. It seems like there is a new Snowden revelation every month, and each one makes me a little less trusting of the federal government.<p>

<strong>2. Your Data Is Not Safe Online</strong><p>

<a href="http://media.giphy.com/media/XuKX7zm7Quu4w/giphy.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-489" alt="facebook" src="http://media.giphy.com/media/XuKX7zm7Quu4w/giphy.gif" width="500" height="340" /></a><p>

Stop oversharing. Because, as it turns out, the NSA has been "extracting audio, video, photographs, e-mails, documents and connection logs that enable analysts to track a person’s movements and contacts over time," <u><a title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-intelligence-mining-data-from-nine-us-internet-companies-in-broad-secret-program/2013/06/06/3a0c0da8-cebf-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-intelligence-mining-data-from-nine-us-internet-companies-in-broad-secret-program/2013/06/06/3a0c0da8-cebf-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html">according to the Washington Post</a></u>. The program, PRISM, lets U.S. intelligence get access to data from Internet companies including Apple, Google and Yahoo without providing individual warrants.<p>

Although the companies deny providing "back-door" access to the government and are making a call for swift and <u><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/09/nsa-surveillance-tech-companies-demand-sweeping-changes-to-us-laws" target="_blank">severe changes to the country's surveillance laws</a></u>, it remains to be seen if our privacy is saved.<p>

This seems like a really great time to remind you all that <u><a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/11/19/facebook-integration-everywhere#feed=/search?keyword=facebook+integration&amp;awesm=~oqlUtUjYimThQ0" target="_blank">Facebook is trying to integrate with everything</a></u>. The company encourages you to give up more information each time you download an application, share a photo, or check-in to a new location. Your personal data is stored on the platform forever and can be accessed via Graph Search—a highly sophisticated search engine that can reveal your profile simply by searching things including location and Likes.<p>

<strong>3. Snapchat Was Allegedly Valued At $4 Billion</strong><p>

<a href="http://media0.giphy.com/media/i9nkolRQgbN9C/giphy.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-491" alt="what" src="http://media0.giphy.com/media/i9nkolRQgbN9C/giphy.gif" width="427" height="240" /></a><p>

A messaging startup with an unusable interface and literally no revenue turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook, and was, at one point, <u><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/15/5106950/google-snapchat-4-billion-buyout-rumor" target="_blank">allegedly valued at $4 billion</a></u>. Now, I'm not saying Snapchat is some horrible application, I don't understand it, and "KIDS THESE DAYS!!" but, as a person who is a fan of viable business, this makes me wonder. I hope my cynicism is proven wrong in 2014.<p>

<strong>4. Bitcoin</strong><p>

<a href="http://media.giphy.com/media/GMIbzgzyS4pws/giphy.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-492" alt="bitcoin" src="http://media.giphy.com/media/GMIbzgzyS4pws/giphy.gif" width="574" height="318" /></a><p>

Seriously, I can't even trust money now. 2013 was the year of Bitcoin; even my mom was talking about how great it is. The fluctuating currency based entirely on the people that put up money to build it, not backed by any government entity, and relies on the denizens of the Internet for its success has had a better year than the U.S. economy. The price of Bitcoin skyrocketed, and at one point was valued at over $1000. The Bitcoin movement spawned <u><a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/12/03/the-bitcoin-alternative-field-guide#feed=/search?keyword=bitcoin&amp;awesm=~oqlME5m6PjyRp8" target="_blank">hundreds of copycat crypto currencies</a></u> and their backers continue to mistrust money and traditional fiat currencies. Though I have to say, I am kicking myself for not picking up a couple back in 2010.<p>

<strong>5. False Reporting</strong><p>

<a href="http://media.giphy.com/media/EAX4h31PLJDz2/giphy.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-493" alt="journalism" src="http://media.giphy.com/media/EAX4h31PLJDz2/giphy.gif" width="497" height="233" /></a><p>

<em>60 Minutes</em>, come on! The last few weeks have proven to be some of the worst in the history of the Sunday night news program. Lara Logan's <u><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/11/26/60-minutes-and-benghazi-five-hard-realities/" target="_blank">Benghazi report was completely false</a></u>, and a perfect example of a failure to fact-check and investigate numerous sources. Then Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos touted his <u><a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/12/02/for-prime-air-to-become-a-reality-amazon-must-solve-these-problems-first#feed=/search?keyword=amazon+drones&amp;awesm=~oqlQFeoF628lCT" target="_blank">drone delivery program</a></u> that may or may not happen on <em>60 Minutes</em>; essentially an advertisement with the allusion of editorial <em>days before </em>the biggest online shopping day of the year. (Way to go, Amazon marketing team.) Finally, the news program promised a look inside the National Security agency, but instead <u><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/15/5214452/60-minutes-softball-NSA-expose" target="_blank">showed NSA propaganda</a></u> complete with softball questions and an Edward Snowden takedown.

Way to go, journalism.

Certainly there were many more times I questioned my belief in human decency. The government provided me with more face-palm worthy fodder than I can illustrate with gifs, including the memorable <u><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/09/who-gets-screwed-shutdown-poor-people-old-people-basically-everyone" target="_blank">government shutdown</a></u>. And living in San Francisco and regularly hearing about <u><a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/happy-holidays-startup-ceo-complains-sf-is-full-of-hum-1481067192" target="_blank">successful entrepreneurs</a></u> bashing on homeless and less fortunate people grates my nerves.

But I believe there are better things to come in 2014. Especially if we all recognize there are things in our community, our government, and our lives we want to change. So, I'll maintain my healthy distrust of literally everything, make an effort to shed light on it as a journalist, and continue to be a voice for change with the hope our society doesn't end up like the <em>Hunger Games. </em>Of course, if it did, I would obviously be Katniss.
