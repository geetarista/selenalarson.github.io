I'm the type of person that has a million things on my to-do list.
I want to travel more, write a book, learn to code, move somewhere new, learn to play the guitar and continue to play the piano. Just to name a few. But recently I have learned that it's hard to do everything I want to, and impossible to do it all well.<p>

Perhaps the reason I have all these aspirations is because I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. Do I want to be an author? A videographer? Own my own business? A few months ago I sat down to figure out exactly what it was on my list that was my highest priority, with the hope of figuring out my personal and professional life.<p>

With the help of two very supportive people, I pared down my list and selected two things to do, and do them well. I decided to answer one of the questions: do I want to be an author? So, I started writing a book that takes readers on a journey through the emotional and personal development of a recent graduate. I have written over 50 pages so far, and although I should be moving quicker, I'm happy with my progress.<p>

</a>I also designed an app for my travel blog. Oh yeah, I have a <u><a href="http://seekingcities.com">travel blog</a></u>. Seeking Cities started as a way for me to talk about all the places I've been and what makes them unique. I'm still populating it regularly, but I realize I need to take a vacation soon so I can have more content. The app is now available on the iPhone app store. So I can check that off the list. (Thank you to my talented developer boyfriend who built it for me. I'm lucky to have him around.)<p>

I've learned that streamlining my aspirations and focusing on one or two projects has been quite fulfilling. Not only am I getting things done, but I am learning along the way what I truly want to spend time on. The next project I will be working on is to become a WordPress developer. It's weird how much I like building WP sites.<p>

Taking things one step at a time is hard for me. But I'm learning as I go. And so far, it's been a great journey.
