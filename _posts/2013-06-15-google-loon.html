New Zealand, home of sheep and Lord of the Rings, is the pilot site for <u><a href="http://www.google.com/loon/" target="_blank">Google's new project</a></u>: Loon. At first, the name made me think of something crazy, but of course Balloon Project just doesn't sound as cool. And really, it probably took some crazy dreaming to come up with something this awesome.<p>

The main idea of Project Loon is this: bringing Internet connection to everyone in the world via balloons that float on the edge of space. The goal of the project is to bring Internet access to the two-thirds of the world's population that currently doesn't have access to it.
<p>
In one word? Awesome.
<p>
These floating objects of wonder will be transported by winds and can be steered by moving upward or downward to catch the wind moving in the opposite direction. Special antennas attached to buildings will allow people to connect to the balloon network, and the signal bounces from balloon to balloon before connecting to the global Internet on Earth.
<p>
The balloons are made from polyethylene plastic, almost 50 feet wide and almost 40 feet tall. They're longer-lasting than weather balloons, and a parachute attached to the top lets the balloon slowly descend to a safe landing whenever it needs to. Solar panels power the Loon's electronics, and between using the wind to travel and sunshine for power, Project Loon is powered only be renewable resources.
<p>
Tomorrow 30 balloons will be launched into the atmosphere in Christchurch, New Zealand. The group of pilot testers will be used to refine the project and move forward to the next phase in the future.

Exciting stuff, no?
