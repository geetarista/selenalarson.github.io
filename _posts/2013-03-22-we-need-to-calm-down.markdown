There's been quite a lot of talk in recent weeks about gender roles and prejudice in the technology industry. <p>Marissa Mayer rose to the top of Yahoo on a wave of women's empowerment, only to be questioned by media and other industry leaders when she was breaking the status quo. Adria Richards outed a couple guys at a conference for, let's face it, being guys, and her actions <u><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/20/playhaven-developer-fired-for-making-sexual-jokes-after-sendgrids-developer-evangelist-outs-him-on-twitter/">resulted in the termination</a></u> of multiple employees. Complex Magazine featured an article (and I use that term loosely) entitled <u>"<a href="http://www.complex.com/tech/2013/03/the-40-hottest-women-in-tech">The 40 Hottest Women in Tech</a>,"</u> and a storm of Twitter fire ensued.

Forget the glass ceiling, this week we've been floored.

But it's not the actions that shock me, rather the reactions from people both in and out of the industry. Mayer <u><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/6/4070338/beware-of-broken-glass-the-medias-double-standard-for-women-at-the-top">faced media backlash</a></u> when she instituted a "no working from home," policy as the new Yahoo CEO that included discussion of her role as a mother and the "work-life-balance." Richards received <u><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/22/adria-richards-im-staying-safe/">rape and death threats</a></u> from the misogynistic corners of the internet. And Twitter was <u><a href="https://twitter.com/ericajanes/status/315193293367566336">up in arms</a></u> over the poorly-worded Complex article.

All I can say is: WHAT?!

I'm no stranger to stereotypes. I'm a young, blonde, outgoing female that has often been categorized as "ditzy." I was once asked in a job interview why I didn't want to be on camera, "Because isn't that what you girls do?" When I moved into a collaborative workspace that was 90 percent male, I'm sure unkind things were said about my looks, personality or job. When I had discussions about job hunting, someone said that being a young woman of "child-bearing age," would be a factor in my hire-ability.

But guess what? I'm proud to be a decent-looking woman with surprising intelligence that wants to work in technology. These things don't scare me.

Technology is a boys club. I get it. Society gets it. And the girls that want to be a part of it generally get it, too. But when poorly-worded opinions, reactionary decision making and bad timing combine, the Internet becomes a slew of feminist sign-holders, sexist bigots, and a clone army of that gross neighbor who stares at you out his window drooling.

Yes it's true; the number of women in technology, especially in development and engineering, is a little disheartening. (The real <u><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/markfidelman/2012/06/05/heres-the-real-reason-there-are-not-more-women-in-technology/2/">root of the problem</a></u> is that STEM education isn't encouraged or sought after by female children, but I won't go into that here). But it's not necessarily an issue that needs to be harped upon until our ears bleed, or written about regularly by various news outlets.

When problems perceived as gender-based arise, ignore every possible way to make it about gender.

In Marissa Mayer's case: Was her decision to make employees work from home unique? Yes. Was it because she was a female CEO? No. Would the story have been different had she been a man? Maybe, but why bring up the fact she is a woman at all? She's a CEO that's shaking things up. Kudos. I hope it works out for her.

As for Adria Richards: Were the guys saying inappropriate things? Yes. (Note: I've made some dongle jokes myself because dongle is a ridiculously funny word). Should she have taken their photo and broadcast it on Twitter? Certainly not. Her excuse for not saying anything to them was because she felt intimidated. Sorry, bad excuse. They're developers. At a conference. (Jolie O'Dell of Venture Beat wrote a wonderful <u><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/22/pycon-2013/">alternative here</a>)</u>.

The mess of comments she received about threats of violence were completely and totally wrong. That's a whole different issue, I still don't get it.

And Complex Magazine: Guys, have you actually <em>read</em> Complex? Some of their other articles include <u>"<a href="http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/03/30-date-movies-thatll-get-you-laid/">30 Date Movies that will Get You Laid</a>"</u> and <u>"<a href="http://www.complex.com/city-guide/2013/03/50-places-to-have-sex-before-you-die/">50 Places to Have Sex Before you Die</a></u><em>." </em>The piece was actually pretty tame compared to their regularly published articles; it didn't mention how physically attractive any of the women are (though it did mention a couple went to PlayBoy) but was based around their talent as technology or business superstars.

The tech scene is unique. The people that work in it are unique. It can be intimidating as a woman to enter a room full of male developers and find common ground. But it can also be intimidating as a male developer to be approached by the only woman in the room.

Let's face it. There doesn't need to be an upheaval of gender roles in technology (or any industry, really). What there <em>does</em> need to be is a growth of mutual respect and understanding. Once that replaces the hermaphroditical elephant in the room, the world will be a better place.
