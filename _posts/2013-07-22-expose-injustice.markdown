It’s easy to be pissed off when a young man is killed. The <u><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/21/us-usa-florida-shooting-idUSBRE96J03W20130721">Trayvon Martin case</a></u> has raised some outcry from both the mainstream media and an American community that wants justice for his death. But what about the <a href="http://apps.washingtonpost.com/national/fallen/">6,668 U.S. casualties</a> suffered in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars since 2001? It seems to me a nation should care about them, too.<p>

I’m not discrediting people’s feelings. I’m happy people have a voice and want to use it to raise awareness for an issue they feel is overlooked. The last few weeks have made it seem like the U.S. suddenly cares about social justice and wants some things to change.<p>

But attending a protest doesn’t do anything. As <u><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/romany-malco/a-message-to-trayvon-mart_b_3612231.html?utm_hp_ref=mostpopular" target="_blank">this editorial points out</a></u>, rage does nothing if people don’t do anything to change the status quo.<p>

I’m all about supporting causes and protesting when the moment calls for it, so I would like to point out some concerns in our country that seem to be ignored by the general population. In case you feel like some other social issue needs your attention.<p>
<ul>
	<li>A study spanning a quarter of a decade has <u><a href="http://articles.philly.com/2013-07-21/news/40709969_1_hallam-hurt-so-called-crack-babies-funded-study" target="_blank">debunked the belief</a></u> that “crack babies” are automatically destined to have a low IQ, poor health, and a life of permanent inferiority. In fact, the study concluded that, “Poverty is a more powerful influence on the outcome of inner-city children than gestational exposure to cocaine." Poverty, unbalanced homes, and affection-less childhoods have a higher impact on having a healthy and successful future than being born a “crack baby.” Which brings me to my next point.</li>
	<li><u><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/06/this-viral-video-is-right-we-need-to-worry-about-wealth-inequality/" target="_blank">Wealth and income inequality</a></u> in America are at an all-time high. In the last 30 years, the bottom 60 percent has seen their wealth shrink, while the top 5 percent has seen huge gains. This means that wealthy people can financially back politicians, provide higher education opportunities for their children, and set them up to be financially stable in the future.</li>
	<li>But some people don’t have a future. Prisoners in Guantanamo Bay have been locked up without trial since the prison was established in 2002. The President has promised to close it twice, but it is still open and the 166 remaining prisoners have been in <u>“<a href="http://dianedimond.net/guantanamo-bay-prison-what-have-we-wrought/" target="_blank">imprisoned limbo</a>”</u> and more than half of them have been on a hunger strike. Some are unable to move. The government is force-feeding them through tubes, some for over six years.</li>
</ul><p>
I could go on. And as long as we’re all abandoning the groupthink mentality, I thought I’d throw a few more issues that could benefit from the nation shining light on them. And perhaps, make a change.
