Google announced <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html">earlier this week</a> that the popular RSS platform Google Reader will be shut down in July. And while many people are bemoaning the closure of the content aggregator, others are completely happy moving on to other services.

The elimination of the monopolizing feed reader opens doors for other content aggregators to grow their share of users. One application reaping the benefits of Google’s decision is <a href="http://www.feedly.com/">Feedly</a>, which saw an influx of more than 500,000 Google Reader users just days after Google’s announcement.

The free service offers an alternative to Google Reader and will allow users to easily migrate their current feed subscriptions before the shut down is official.  Feedly is available for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Android and is currently the <a href="http://devhd.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-14-at-10-25-51-am.png">number one application</a> in the Apple Store.

Google Reader has remained virtually unchanged since it launched in 2005, and the last few years of slowly growing users wasn’t up to Google’s standards.

The company cited two reasons behind the move to close the feed reader on <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/">its blog</a>:

“Usage of Google Reader has declined, and as a company we’re pouring all of our energy into fewer products. We think that kind of focus will make for a better user experience.”

The sub-par treatment of the reader is visible in the non-existent application updates and even a lack of love for the product. The <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2011/10/new-in-reader-fresh-design-and-google.html">last blog post</a> on the official Google Reader blog, before the announcement of the closure, was from October 2011.

Google Reader’s giant shadow has smothered the market for feed readers. Now that it’s gone, perhaps users will now see innovative products hit the market and find a better quality replacement.
