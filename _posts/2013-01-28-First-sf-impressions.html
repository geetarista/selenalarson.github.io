Perhaps it has to do with being surrounded by entrepreneurs all day at <u><a href="http://gangplankhq.com">Gangplank</a></u>, but I have found that when people, businesses and societies work together to reach a common goal, the whole community thrives.That said, competition doesn't hurt.<p>

I recently spent a weekend in San Francisco visiting friends and checking out the city. Part of the reason I went was to see what all my startup friends were always talking about. Conclusion: it is even more awesome than they say.<p>

Apart from the general cool factor as a big city destination, people in San Francisco are surprisingly nice. They say "Hi!" on the streets, let others pet their dogs, and expose a friendly demeanor you often don't find in urban areas.<p>

But what I think sets SF apart from many other cities is a dedication to collaboration and community support. One reason why the Bay Area has been so successful as a tech industry hub is the business leaders' dedication to create a community that promotes creativity, upward mobility, and yes even a little envy.<p>

An example of this is the San Francisco Citizens Initiative for Technology and Innovation (<u><a href="http://www.sfciti.com/about">sf.citi</a></u>), a non-profit organization that encourages industry leaders to harness the power of technology to promote change and civic action in San Francisco. The organization has over 400 company members and is continuously growing.<p>

But big business groups aren't just the ones revolutionizing culture. Companies like <u><a href="http://www.kiip.me/">Kiip</a></u> and <u><a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a></u> are housed in modern workplaces where employees are encouraged to express themselves, stretch their potential and even be friends outside of work. (Side note: IFTTT's marketing swag includes a pair of argyle socks. Win.) Startups in the area are familiar with one another and there are countless opportunities for like-minded people to get together to network, share ideas or drink.<p>

I recently read an <u><a href="http://www.azcentral.com/community/mesa/articles/20120103southeast-valley-leaders-seek-unified-marketing-effort.html" target="_blank">article about the rebranding</a></u> of the Southeast Valley in Arizona. (Most people just call it the East Valley.) Sure, I think centers of business or community need to be unified under a recognizable brand, but shouldn't these brands develop organically?<p>

When smart, driven people come together to develop successful companies, these community changes happen on their own. Cities become (almost) like the Bay Area<i>. </i>Though not as revered yet, cities like <u><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/12/11/finding-big-start-up-ideas-even-in-small-cities/" target="_blank">Boulder and Austin</a></u> are coming into their own as startup towns. But that's all it takes; people wanting to create something awesome with other people revolutionizing their community.<p>

One of my favorite quotes is from Margaret Mead:
<blockquote>“Never doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.”</blockquote><p>
Once more people delve into this way of thinking, communities and businesses alike can flourish.
