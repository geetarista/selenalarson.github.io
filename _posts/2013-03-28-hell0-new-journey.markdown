A week ago, I turned my life upside down and moved to San Francisco. What started off as an improbable dream on New Year's Eve became a whirlwind reality just over two months later.

Although I've visited over 20 countries, I've never lived anywhere outside of Arizona. Before moving to San Francisco, I never spent more than a weekend in the City. I had no idea (and still don't!) what's in store here. Arizona has been my home for over 20 years, but it was definitely time for me to move on.

Yes, I'm leaving Chandler. But what I've learned in the last two years working for the Downtown Chandler Community Partnership and the last year at Gangplank will come with me wherever I go. I have been blessed to be part of a group of dangerous, creative, tough and brilliant individuals who I am lucky to call friends.

There is no better place for me to move forward in my career than San Francisco. I'm still on a journey (and probably will be for a while) of determining what it is exactly that I want to do. I might spend my whole life figuring that out. But at the moment, I want to work for a company that's bending the rules, shining a spotlight on themselves, and all around kicking ass.

After being an anchor at Gangplank, I don't think I can ask for anything less.

<strong>Selena's Life Lessons about being a badass (as learned from the pirates at Gangplank):</strong>
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>Don't take shit from anyone.</strong> It might take a while for people to understand my value. But when they do, they <em>really </em>understand it. I'm smart, a spitfire, and I'm not going to let anyone stand in my way.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
</span></span></li>
	<li><strong>It's okay to be a little different.</strong> <em></em>I've always been a little bit different, but have usually been able to hide it quite well. But quirky is fun. It's a break from the norm. It makes you stand out from the crowd. The people I want to surround myself with are always going to be a little different. Because normal is just boring.</li>
	<li><strong>Don't be afraid to fail. </strong>Some people go their whole lives without taking risks. To me, that's weird. If you never fail in life you never know what it truly is to succeed, or that you can get up after failing and do something even more amazing. Failure tests you; it shows what kind of person you are. And if you succeed after failing, you're that much better.</li>
	<li><strong>Laughter is entirely acceptable. </strong>I've been told I have a distinct laugh. I'm pretty sure when I first went to Gangplank I disrupted the space with my obvious giggle. But I think a lot of things are funny, and I'm not going to hide it. Also, it's fun when someone says to me, "You're the one with the laugh!" And it's quite a compliment when I'm told my laughter is going to be missed.</li>
	<li><strong>Get to know people, they might surprise you. </strong>This one I turn both inwardly and outwardly. After getting over the initial intimidation of being in a space with the top minds in Chandler, I spoke up and got to know my neighbors. They turned out to be pretty rad, and I'm sure they would say the same for me.
<strong></strong></li>
	<li><strong>It's entirely possible to do what you want. </strong>Working with and around entrepreneurs makes you realize, you can do whatever you want. Some of them went the corporate route first, but others have always known they were pirates at heart. If you want something, take it. If you have a dream, just go for it. And good things will happen.</li>
</ul>
