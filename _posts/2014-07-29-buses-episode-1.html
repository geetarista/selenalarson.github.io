"Oops, I'm so sorry," I said as stepped on the man's boot while riding in the packed 38L bus cutting through downtown San Francisco.
<p>
"Don't worry about it, these things can handle anything," the older man said.
<p>
He smiled, and his white-bearded face lit up under his worn, tan baseball cap. A handsome green flannel shirt peeked out underneath a light matching jacket.
<p>
"I got these boots a long time ago ... they'll last me until I'm dead," he laughed. "Which is admittedly less time than you have."
<p>
I pointed to my flip flops and lamented the lack of protective fabric.
<p>
"What do you do?" he asked.
<p>
I told him I'm a tech reporter, and he asked about my coverage area—social media.
<p>
"People aren't very introspective on social media, are they?" he asked. "People aren't what they used to be."
<p>
He works as a systems architect at Macy's in San Francisco. He lives in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood on the same bus line as mine.
<p>
"I'm heading home, but first I'm going to the Pig and Whistle," he said. He told me it's a great Irish bar, and they make you feel right at home—though he advised against going there alone.
<p>
"I went to Ireland once," he said. "I'd live there, but it wouldn't be the top of my list."
<p>
"Where would you like to live the most?" I asked.
<p>
"Tokyo."
<p>
People have more laid back yet vibrant lives in Japan, he said. The man would know because he lived there for three years as an expat.
<p>
"It's hard to learn Japanese in Japan because everyone knows English," he smiled, recalling his time there. The store clerks would give him a look of surprise, then a grin, if he tried to speak their language.
<p>
We were coming up to my stop, and I pulled the cord.
<p>
"I'd invite you to the Pig and Whistle, but you probably have other plans," he said.
<p>
"My own happy hour," though I said it begrudgingly.
<p>
"Well maybe I'll see you again!"
<p>
I shook his hand.
<p>
"I hope."
