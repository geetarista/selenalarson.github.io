We've all seen the <u><a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/1682169/coding-is-coming-to-every-industry-you-can-think-of-time-to-start-learning-it-now" target="_blank">articles</a></u>. "Teach yourself and your children to code or you will fail miserably at life and everything you do!"<p>

Okay, not really. But as the job landscape moves increasingly toward tech-centric fields, it is not a bad idea to learn at least some basic HTML. I learned quite a bit of it in college, and can find my way around a Stylesheet, but I have decided it's time for me to brush up on it, and start my slow ascent into the coding world.<p>

I'm quite happy to have discovered <u><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0" target="_blank">Codeacademy</u> </a>and finally get started on something I've put off way too long: teach myself to code (for real). Codeacademy a great resource for step-by-step breakdowns of anything you want to learn about coding. From basic Web Fundamentals (HTML &amp; CSS) to Ruby and PHP. And a little bit of everything in between.<p>

Right now I'm brushing up on HTML. Yeah, it's easy and I could probably be moving on to JavaScript, but I have a feeling things get a little more complicated down the line, and I will be thankful for Codeacademy taking it slow for me.<p>

I'll be posting my progress periodically. Hopefully I'll have something cool built here pretty soon. In the meantime, try it out for yourself. Stop posting that you really should try to learn to code, and actually do it.
