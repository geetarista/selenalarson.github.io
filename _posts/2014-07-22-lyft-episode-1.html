I was sweaty and smelled like hot dogs as I waited outside the Internapalooza event anxiously looking for my Lyft driver. Though the San Francisco summer night was cool and breezy, I couldn’t shake the claustrophobia I felt standing among 1000 interns earlier. <p>

A white van with a mustache pulled up across the street. I ran to it, jaywalking.
<p>
“Hi, nice to meet you,” my driver put out his fist for me to bump. He sat smiling in a backwards Giants cap, with a crisp white shirt and cargo shorts. 
<p>
“I’m Selena,” I bumped his outstretched hand. 
<p>
We rode in silence for a few moments before I asked him how busy the night was. 
<p>
“I’ve been driving for three hours, but it hasn’t been too busy. I would know because of Prime Time,” he said. 
<p>
He has been working for Lyft for several months; before that, he drove for Sidecar, and even further back in his work history, he once drove a cab. 
<p>
“There are so many Lyft drivers now,” he said, without any resentment. I couldn’t help but think about how hard it is to compete with them all while trying to make a living driving cars. 
<p>
I couldn’t do it. 
<p>
“Are you from the Bay Area?” I asked.
<p>
“Yes, my mother moved us all over here 30 years ago, and we never left,” he smiled. “I live over by Cow Palace now.”
<p>
“Where did you move from?”
<p>
“Thailand.”
<p>
A Prius cab pulled up next to us at a stop light. The male driver shouted something through the open window. My driver rolled his down. 
<p>
“I’m going to start a company with white mustaches, like old men!” the cab driver said, moving his hands under his nose. 
<p>
“Good! I will drive for you!” he replied, laughing.
<p>
“He was nice,” he said as the cab pulled away. 
<p>
“Yeah, I heard cab drivers can be jerks to Lyft and Uber drivers,” I said, recalling the torturous tales I’ve been told. 
<p>
“One time a cab driver was across the street from me, and he pulled out one of those really bright red laser lights. He shined it right in my eyes. <i>‘How does that feel?’</i>’” His happy demeanor darkened. 
<p>
“It really hurts,” he rubbed his eyes, recalling the memory. “But you know? I get both sides. I was a cab driver for five years, but when I left, there were only 1,800 cabs. 1,800 cabs! For a city with a million people!” 
<p>
He shook his head. 
<p>
“There just aren’t enough cabs for the number of people,” 
<p>
He asked me where I was from, and we joked about the Arizona weather. It’s about 100 degrees right now in Phoenix, 115 during the day. 
<p>
“It can get really hot in Thailand, but it’s usually beautiful.”
<p>
“How often do you go back?”
<p>
“Well, every three years now,” he said. 
<p>
“Is your family still here?” 
<p>
“Yes, my mother brought all of us, and we’re still here.”
<p>
We’d reached my destination. I was home, after a long day of work. My driver’s day was just beginning. 
<p>
“It was nice to meet you, maybe I’ll pick you up again sometime!”
<p>
I hoped he would.
