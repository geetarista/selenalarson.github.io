The new <u><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2013/04/03/new-apis-for-comment-replies/">Facebook API</a> </u>allows developers to build tools that make it easier for brands to monitor and respond to comment replies. This comes on the heels of <u><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/25/facebook-comments-threads/">last week’s announcement</a></u> that Facebook will allow comment replies on pages and profiles with more than 10,000 followers.<p>

Pages can choose to activate this new comment feature by going to their Admin Panel and selecting “Manage permissions.” Facebook tested the new comment feature on Pages like ESPN and the Huffington Post and received positive reviews. Although this feature is still optional, it will implemented to all pages and profiles with more than 10,000 followers in July.<p>

The new API now supports different “views” of the comments on posts through the updated <u><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/Comment/">comments API</u> </a>and <u><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/comment/">FQL comment table</a></u>.<p>

The <u><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graphapi/guides/comments/#threaded">documentation</a></u> includes new details on how to use the features including reading comments, creating comment replies, and deleting comment replies. The <u><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/roadmap/">Roadmap</a></u> Facebook has posted lists detailed information on the API changes and outlines all modifications going into effect permanently on July 10.
