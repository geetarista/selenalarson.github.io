And by that I mean, putting faith in myself and moving forward one step at a time.<p>

Things in life that matter to me:<p>
<ul>
	<li>Freedom</li>
	<li>Happiness</li>
	<li>Enough Time</li>
</ul><p>
I realized that the only way to fully achieve these is to take a chance on something I've always wanted to do, but have been held back by thoughts of "What if I fail?"<p>

The reality? If I fail, I will find something else and move on. Failure is inevitable. Sometime in our life we all fail. I have in the past and I will in the future. So why not take a risk and do something I've been fantasizing about since college?  There is no reason not to.<p>

So far, it's been fun. Thinking about all the opportunities I can have and where they will take me. It's also been a bit terrifying; I won't lie. If you've been following my series on Medium, you might have been able to sense some of my own personal story come out. No, it's not actually a chronicle of my life, but there are bits and pieces of me in it.<p>

I'm lucky that I live in a city that flourishes on taking risks. I'm lucky that I know such wonderful people that are supporting me and sending opportunities my way.<p>

So, here's to risk taking and success. I have a feeling it will be an adventure.<p>
